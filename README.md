# Jakarta Air Quality Classification
This project aims to create a model that can predict future air pollution levels. Thus, it can help the government and related agencies in analyzing the factors that affect Jakarta's air quality. 

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at the following link: [Air Quality Index in Jakarta (2010 - 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/senadu34/air-quality-index-in-jakarta-2010-2021). Please download the dataset from the provided link before running the code.

# Objective
The objective of the air pollution index classification project in the city of Jakarta is to develop a predictive model capable of classifying air quality within a specific range of pollution indices.Through the analysis of historical data and environmental variables such as air particulate levels, hazardous gas concentrations, and other factors that affect air quality, this project aims to create a model that can predict future air pollution levels. Thus, it can help the government and related agencies in analyzing the factors that affect Jakarta's air quality. The results of this analysis can be used to formulate effective policies and strategies to take appropriate measures to reduce the impact of air pollution in Jakarta, as well as provide more timely information to the public to protect their health.
